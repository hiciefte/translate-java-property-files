# Contributing to Translate Java Property Files

Thank you for wanting to help improve this project!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository, then clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TranslateJavaProperties.git
   cd TranslateJavaProperties
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # or for Windows:
   # python -m venv venv
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- All PRs should be made against the `main` branch.
- Include a concise description of the changes.
- Ensure that all tests pass locally (run `pytest -v`).
- Maintain a consistent coding style; run `black .` (or your preferred formatter) before committing if youâ€™ve configured one.

## Python Dependency Management

This project uses `pip-tools` to manage Python dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.

-   **`requirements.in`**: This file contains the primary, top-level dependencies for the application (e.g., `openai`, `pyyaml`).
-   **`requirements-dev.in`**: This file contains dependencies used only for development and testing (e.g., `pytest`).
-   **`requirements.txt`** and **`requirements-dev.txt`**: These are the **locked** dependency files generated by `pip-compile`. They contain the exact versions of all top-level and transitive dependencies. **Do not edit these files manually.**

### Updating Dependencies

When you need to add or update a Python dependency, please edit the appropriate `.in` file:

-   `requirements.in` for production dependencies.
-   `requirements-dev.in` for development and testing dependencies.

After editing, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have `pip-tools` installed in your environment (`pip install pip-tools`).
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
3.  Re-compile the locked requirement files by running the following commands from the project root:
    ```bash
    # (Optionally add --generate-hashes for stronger integrity)
    pip-compile requirements.in --generate-hashes
    pip-compile requirements-dev.in --generate-hashes
    ```
4.  Commit the changes to both the `.in` file and the generated `.txt` file to your pull request.

### Installing the locked dependencies locally
Use pip-tools' pip-sync to exactly match the lockfiles:
```bash
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```

## Code Style
This project uses `black` for code formatting and `ruff` for linting. Please ensure your contributions are formatted correctly before submitting a pull request.
You can run the formatter and linter from the project root:
```bash
black .
ruff . --fix
```
This will automatically format your code and fix any simple linting issues.
