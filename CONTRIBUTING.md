# Contributing to Translate Java Property Files

Thank you for wanting to help improve this project!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository, then clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TranslateJavaProperties.git
   cd TranslateJavaProperties
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # or for Windows:
   # python -m venv venv
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- All PRs should be made against the `main` branch.
- Include a concise description of the changes.
- Ensure that all tests pass locally (run `pytest -v`).
- Maintain a consistent coding style; run `black .` (or your preferred formatter) before committing if youâ€™ve configured one.

## Python Dependency Management

This project uses `pip-tools` to manage Python dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.

-   **`requirements.in`**: This file contains the primary, top-level dependencies for the application (e.g., `openai`, `pyyaml`).
-   **`requirements-dev.in`**: This file contains dependencies used only for development and testing (e.g., `pytest`).
-   **`requirements.txt`** and **`requirements-dev.txt`**: These are the **locked** dependency files generated by `pip-compile`. They contain the exact versions of all top-level and transitive dependencies. **Do not edit these files manually.**

### Updating Dependencies

If you need to add, remove, or update a dependency:
1.  Modify the appropriate `.in` file (`requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in`).
2.  Install `pip-tools` if you haven't already: `pip install pip-tools`.
3.  Re-compile the locked requirement files by running the following commands from the project root:
    ```bash
    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip-compile requirements-dev.in
    ```
4.  Commit the changes to both the `.in` file and the generated `.txt` file to your pull request.
