# Concurrency setting for OpenAI API calls.
# This controls how many API requests can be active at the same time.
# A lower value (e.g., 1 or 2) is safer to avoid API rate limits.
# A higher value can speed up translation but may lead to "429 Too Many Requests" errors.
# Default value if not specified is 1.
