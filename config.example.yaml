# (Optional) If specified, only files matching this glob pattern will be sent for AI translation.
# All other changed .properties files will still be included in the final PR.

# Optional: Process all translation files under input_folder instead of only git-changed files.
# Useful for one-time ledger bootstrap or forced full retranslation runs.
# Keep false for normal incremental operation.

# Optional: Pull source files (*_en.properties) from Transifex as well as translations.
# Set to `true` if the canonical source of truth for English strings is Transifex.
# The default behavior (`false`) is to only pull translation files and assume
# the source files in the Git repository are the source of truth.

# Concurrency setting for OpenAI API calls.
# This controls how many API requests can be active at the same time.
# A lower value (e.g., 1 or 2) is safer to avoid API rate limits.
# A higher value can speed up translation but may lead to "429 Too Many Requests" errors.
# Default value if not specified is 1.
