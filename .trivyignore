# Ignore vulnerabilities found in the third-party Transifex CLI (tx) binary.
# This is a known issue with the vendor's build process, and we accept the risk
# as the CLI is only used to communicate with Transifex's official API.
# There is currently no newer official release available with patched versions.

# CVE-2025-22868: Vulnerability in `golang.org/x/net/html` token parsing.
# Rationale: Low-risk (memory consumption) in our controlled CI environment.
# Added: 2025-09-04
# Revisit by: 2025-10-15
CVE-2025-22868

# CVE-2025-47907: Vulnerability in `requests` library regarding proxy auth.
# Rationale: Not exploitable as we do not use proxies in the affected component.
# Added: 2025-09-04
# Revisit by: 2025-10-15
CVE-2025-47907

# CVE-2025-47906: Go os/exec.LookPath PATH environment variable handling vulnerability.
# Affects: yq (v1.22.4), tx (v1.16.15), gosu (v1.18.2) - all Go binaries
# Rationale: Low risk in our containerized environment with controlled PATH and no user input to LookPath.
# The affected binaries are system utilities used in controlled contexts, not user-facing components.
# Recent CVE (Sep 2025) - waiting for vendor updates to Go stdlib used in these binaries.
# Added: 2025-09-21

# CVE-2025-47912, CVE-2025-58183, CVE-2025-58186, CVE-2025-58187, CVE-2025-58188, CVE-2025-61724
# Go stdlib vulnerabilities affecting third-party binaries (gh, tx, gosu)
# Affects: gh (Go v1.22.4), tx (Go v1.16.15), gosu (Go v1.18.2)
# Vulnerabilities:
#   - CVE-2025-47912: IPv6 Parse function permits non-IPv6 values (fixed in Go 1.24.8, 1.25.2)
#   - CVE-2025-58183: tar.Reader lacks max size limit on sparse file entries (fixed in Go 1.24.8, 1.25.2)
#   - CVE-2025-58186: HTTP header count limit bypass (fixed in Go 1.24.8, 1.25.2)
#   - CVE-2025-58187: Certificate name constraint checking performance issue (fixed in Go 1.24.9, 1.25.3)
#   - CVE-2025-58188: DSA public key validation excessive memory consumption (fixed in Go 1.24.8, 1.25.2)
#   - CVE-2025-61724: HTTP ReadResponse string concatenation memory issue (fixed in Go 1.24.8, 1.25.2)
# Rationale: These are CI/CD tools (gh, tx) and privilege escalation utility (gosu) used exclusively
#            in controlled containerized environments for build/deployment automation. They do not
#            process untrusted user input and are not exposed to external networks. The binaries are
#            vendor-supplied pre-compiled releases that we cannot rebuild. Actual exploitation risk
#            is minimal given the controlled usage context. Vendors (especially Transifex with Go 1.16.15
#            from 2022) are unlikely to release patched versions soon.
# Added: 2025-11-06
# Revisit by: 2026-01-15 (check for updated vendor releases)

# Go stdlib vulnerabilities affecting vendor-supplied Go binaries in the image.
# Affects: tx (Transifex CLI), gosu, and potentially yq depending on upstream build toolchain.
# Rationale: These binaries are used only in controlled CI/CD/container contexts and are
#            not exposed as user-facing services. We cannot directly patch their embedded
#            Go stdlib; mitigation depends on upstream binary releases.
# Added: 2026-02-17
# Revisit by: 2026-04-15 (re-check upstream releases and rebuild provenance)
