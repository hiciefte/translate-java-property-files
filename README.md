# Translate Java Property Files

This project automates the translation of Java `.properties` files into multiple languages using OpenAI's GPT-based APIs. It integrates with Git to detect changes, pulls the latest translations from Transifex, performs AI-based translation and review for new strings, and creates a pull request with the results.

The entire process is designed to be run as an automated, scheduled job on a server, but can also be easily run in a local development environment.

## Features

*   **Automated Translation**: Uses OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4o) to translate new or changed strings.
*   **Two-Step Quality Process**: A fast initial translation is followed by a robust, chunked AI review step to ensure consistency and quality while avoiding API rate limits.
*   **Git Integration**: Detects changed files, commits new translations with GPG signatures, and creates pull requests automatically.
*   **Transifex Integration**: Pulls the latest manual translations from Transifex before running the AI pipeline.
*   **Automated Error Reporting**: Validation and linter errors for skipped files are automatically added to the pull request description for high visibility.
*   **Glossary & Style Rules**: Enforces consistent terminology and tone using a `config.yaml` file.
*   **Dockerized Environment**: Runs as a Docker container for consistent and portable deployment.
*   **Secure Git Authentication**: Uses a baked-in, read-only SSH deploy key to securely interact with Git repositories, avoiding exposure of host-level keys.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The `translator` service is designed to run in a Docker container. This is the only recommended way to run the service. The process is identical for local testing and server deployment, using Docker to create a secure and consistent environment.
Before building locally, enable BuildKit:
```bash
export DOCK-ER_BUILDKIT=1 COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
```

### 1.1. Deploy Key Setup

The service uses an SSH deploy key to interact with Git repositories.

-   **Generate a new key:** Create a new SSH key specifically for this service (it's recommended to use the `ed25519` algorithm). Do not use a password/passphrase for this key.
-   **Add to GitHub:** Add the public key as a deploy key to the GitHub repository you want to push translations to. **Crucially, you must check "Allow write access."**
-   **Place the key:** Put the private key file in the `secrets/deploy_key/` directory. By default, the system looks for a file named `id_ed25519`.
    ```text
    secrets/deploy_key/id_ed25519
    ```
-   **Custom key name (optional):** If your key file has a different name, you must create a file named `.env` inside the `docker/` directory and specify the filename:
    ```env
    # In docker/.env
    DEPLOY_KEY_NAME=your_key_name_here
    ```

### 1.2. Configuration

-   Copy the `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`.
-   Edit `config.yaml` and set the `target_project_root` to the path where the Git repository will be cloned inside the container. This is typically `/target_repo`.
-   Set the `input_folder` to the path (relative to `target_project_root`) where the `.properties` files are located.

### 1.3. Building and Running the Service

Once the deploy key is in place and the configuration is set, you can build and run the service with a single command from the project root:

   ```bash
# To run the full translation and PR creation pipeline
docker compose run --rm translator
```

**NOTE:** The baked-in deploy key must be read-only and scoped to the target repo, rotated regularly, and used only in non-public images. With this in place, `git push` works across platforms; SSH agent forwarding is no longer needed.

### 2. Server Deployment Details

For comprehensive instructions on setting up the automated translation service on a production server (e.g., a cloud VM), including the cron job configuration, please follow the full guide:

‚û°Ô∏è **[New Project Deployment Guide](./docs/new-project-deployment.md)**

### 3. Local Development (Legacy Python Script)

For situations where Docker is not available, you can run the Python script directly using a local script. This method has more dependencies (e.g., `tx` CLI, Python environment) and is not the recommended approach.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.11+
*   Transifex CLI (`tx`) installed and on your `PATH`.
*   A `config.yaml` file configured for your local paths.

**Run the Script:**
```bash
./run-local-translation.sh /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The service is configured through a combination of YAML files and a single environment file for secrets.

*   **`docker/.env`**: **Secrets.** Contains all sensitive information: API keys, tokens, and Git repository URLs. This file is not checked into version control. Use `docker/.env.example` as a template.
*   **`config.yaml`**: **Local configuration.** Used by `run-local-translation.sh` for local, non-Docker runs.
*   **`docker/config.docker.yaml`**: **Server configuration.** This is the configuration file used by the service when running inside Docker. It points to paths within the container (e.g., `/target_repo`).
*   **`glossary.json`**: Provides language-specific translations for key terms to ensure consistency.
*   **`translation_file_filter_glob`** (optional, in `config.yaml`): A glob pattern that limits which changed `.properties` files are processed by the AI translator. This is useful for workflows where you want to pull all updated files from Transifex but only run the AI step on a specific subset (e.g., `mobile_*.properties`).

## Troubleshooting

*   **`Permission denied (publickey)` Errors**: This error during `git push` means the deploy key specified in `secrets/deploy_key/` has not been added to your target GitHub repository's "Deploy Keys" section with write access.
*   **Validation Errors in Pull Request**: The PR description now includes a report of any files that were skipped due to linter or validation errors. These errors must be fixed manually in the source repository. See `docs/llm/debug-docker-service.md` for more details on common errors.
*   **Server Deployment Issues**: Refer to the detailed deployment guide and the debugging documentation in the `docs/` directory.
